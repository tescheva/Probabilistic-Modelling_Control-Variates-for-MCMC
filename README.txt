How to proceed in order to replicate our results:

1. Load and execute all scripts from folder "Relevant scripts from the sgmcmc package".
2. Read and run script "Preliminary Analysis of Logistic Regression Example".
3. Read and run script "GridSearch" - might take a while ;-)
4. Read and run script "PlottingForReport"

If you want to replicate our work without running the grid search (which took us 10 hours), please contact us in order to receive our workspace.
